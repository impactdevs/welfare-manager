# Leave Roster

The Leave Roster module is crucial for managing annual leave schedules. Staff members can log in to **UNCST HRMIS** to plan and track their leave days.

## Adding a Leave Schedule

1. **Navigate to the Leave Roster:**
   - Under the **General** section, click on the **Leave Roster** menu item.

2. **Select your Leave Dates:**
   - Choose your leave start and end dates on the calendar UI.
   - Left-click and hold on the calendar starting from the start date, then release once you reach the end date. The selected date range will automatically be recorded.

3. **Check the Progress Bar:**
   - Pay attention to the progress bar at the bottom of the calendar. It shows the percentage of your scheduled days relative to your entitled days.

4. **Using the Calendar Controls:**
   - On the right side of the calendar, you'll see three buttons:
     - A **filter dropdown** (visible only to admin users) to filter by departments.
     - An **Add Leave** button, which is an alternative to clicking directly on the calendar to add leave.
   - When you click the **Add Leave** button, a form will appear in a modal. Simply select your dates and submit. Your selected leave dates will then be displayed on the calendar.

5. **Leave Plan Overview:**
   - Below the buttons, you'll see the **Leave Plan** section, which shows the entire leave roster. You can:
     - **Search** through your leave entries.
     - Use **pagination** to navigate through multiple schedules.
     - **Export or Print** your leave schedule using the buttons at the top left of the table.
   - The first time you add a schedule, it will be highlighted in **yellow** on the calendar. After a page reload, the schedule will appear **blue**.

## Removing a Leave Schedule

1. **Delete a Schedule:**
   - To remove a leave schedule, click on the blue highlighted date range on the calendar. 
   - An off-canvas panel will appear on the right side of your screen with a **Delete** button.
   - Click the **Delete** button to remove the leave schedule.

2. **Apply for Leave:**
   - If you wish to apply for a leave schedule, click the **Apply Leave** button next to the **Delete** button.
