# Authentication and Authorization

**UNCST HRMIS** is built with different roles, and permissions can be granted to these roles by the main user (administrator).

The following are the different roles that UNCST HRMIS has been built with:

1. **HR**: 
   - This is the main user, the controller of everything in the software execution. 
   - This role is responsible for configuring permissions for other roles, doing system settings, and many other tasks.
   - Their dashboard is more comprehensive, with much more insights compared to other roles.

2. **Head Of Division/Department**: 
   - This role heads several other employees (other users) to oversee some actions like approvals, posting events, etc.

3. **Executive Secretary**: 
   - This is the head of the entire hierarchy in actions like approval, etc.
   - Their dashboard is the same as the one for HR.

4. **Assistant Executive Secretary**: 
   - This role can be configured to have slightly smaller freedom in the software but with Executive Secretary's rights.
   - The role is meant to stand in for the Executive Secretary in case they are unavailable (e.g., doing leave request approvals and so on).

5. **Staff**: 
   - This is a regular employee who can apply for leave, schedule leave rosters, and add in their daily work expenses.
