## System Configuration Overview

When you **login** to UNCST HRMIS, you will notice that the side navigation bar has 3 sections:
1. **General**
2. **Settings**
3. **Documentation**

These sections have been carefully designed to make it easy for you to navigate through UNCST HRMIS. For this user manual section, we will focus on how the **Settings** work.

**All screenshots in this documentation** have labels bordered in a rectangle with a number. When you see references like **Leave Types(1)**, we are referring to label **1** in the screenshot.
